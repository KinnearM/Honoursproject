# Honoursproject
Python code pertaining to my GW lab project.

So far contains 3 files:

extradim.py contains leakageparam class object which has all the tools you could need (I could think of) to infer the number of spacetime dimensions from GW events.

cosmo.py is contains lots of neat cosmology functions and it required by extradim.

dVddL.txt is a uniform in comoving-volume-time distance prior assuming a Planck 2015 cosmology. Required if your distance posterior had this prior.
